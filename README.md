# Advent of Code

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. This README outlines the core principles guiding the development and implementation of my solutions.

## Principles

### Readability over Algorithm Optimization
In this repository, you'll find that the code prioritizes readability above all. My belief is that, in our era of fast hardware, we can afford a slight trade-off in raw performance for significantly clearer and more maintainable code. This approach makes the solutions easier to understand and maybe even learn from.

### Functional over Imperative
I lean towards functional programming styles rather than imperative ones. The reason? It contributes to code readability and maintainability. Functional code tends to be more concise, easier to debug, and lends itself well to solving these kinds of algorithmic problems.

### Enjoyment is Key
The moment this starts to feel like a chore, Iâ€™ll take a step back. My participation in Advent of Code is driven by the joy of problem-solving and learning and is always within the confines of my available time.

## Technical Details

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.14. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

### Running the Solutions

```bash
bun install
bun test
```
